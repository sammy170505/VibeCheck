# "VibeCheck" ‚Äì Real-Time Emotional Check-In with Friends

**Concept:**
VibeCheck is a social mental health app designed to help friends support each other‚Äôs emotional well-being in real time. It allows users to send quick, emoji-based emotional check-ins to their close friends and receive instant feedback. The app fosters casual, low-pressure emotional connection throughout the day, without the formality of deep conversations, making it feel natural and easy to use.

**Key Features:**
**Quick Emotional Check-Ins (VibeChecks):**
Users can send a "VibeCheck" to their friends or loved ones by choosing from a set of emojis (like a wave üåä for "I'm fine," a cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è for "feeling down," or fire üî• for "excited"). The recipient can respond quickly with a matching or supportive emoji, creating a fast, informal emotional exchange.

**"Vibe Alerts" for Real-Time Support:**
If someone sends a sad or stressed VibeCheck (e.g., üòî), the app notifies the friend group or a selected person that the user could use some support. This feature ensures that users can receive encouragement when they need it most, without having to explicitly ask for help.

**Casual Group Check-Ins:**
Friend groups can set daily or weekly group check-ins where everyone quickly updates their emotional status using emojis or short messages. The app keeps it light, making it easier for people to share their mood without feeling like it‚Äôs a serious or difficult task.

## Future Work

**Emotion Calendar:**
Users can view their emotional history on a calendar with simple visual markers (e.g., blue dots for sad days, yellow for happy days), helping them reflect on their emotional patterns. This data can also be shared with friends to encourage deeper conversations when users feel ready.

**Personalized "Boosts" for Friends:**
When a user sends a negative VibeCheck, the app suggests personalized "boosts" their friends can send in response. These boosts could be things like sending a meme, starting a quick 5-minute chat, or inviting the user for a short walk or coffee break.

**"Pick-Me-Up" Content Library:**
The app offers a library of funny, uplifting, or inspiring content (memes, quotes, short videos) that users can send to a friend who seems down, providing an instant pick-me-up without the pressure of talking things through immediately.

**Silent Check-Ins:**
For users who want to check in emotionally but don't feel like talking, they can send a silent VibeCheck. Friends will receive the update and can send quiet support back, respecting the user's space but showing they are there when needed.

**"Close Circle" Only:**
VibeCheck is designed to be shared only with a user‚Äôs closest friends or family (up to 5-7 people), keeping emotional updates safe and intimate. This creates a small, trusted circle where people feel comfortable sharing how they feel without the worry of oversharing.

**MoodMatch:**
The app can analyze emotional exchanges and suggest when friends might need to reconnect based on their recent VibeChecks. For example, if both friends are feeling down, the app might suggest planning something together to lift their spirits, like a movie night or a quick hangout.

**Check-In Reminders:**
VibeCheck can send gentle reminders to users and their close friends to check in with one another after periods of silence, ensuring that they stay emotionally connected even during busy or stressful times.

## Our Goal
VibeCheck makes emotional well-being casual, approachable, and social by using fun, familiar interactions like emojis and memes. It removes the pressure of serious emotional discussions by allowing users to simply express how they feel with a few taps. The app‚Äôs focus on lightweight emotional check-ins fosters real-time support between friends without turning the process into something overwhelming or difficult.

The goal of VibeCheck is to keep emotional health at the forefront of relationships in a simple, low-effort way, encouraging friends to support each other daily, especially during rough patches. It helps normalize talking about feelings in casual, bite-sized interactions, making emotional wellness part of everyday life.
